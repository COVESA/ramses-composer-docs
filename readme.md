# Ramses Composer Documentation

![](ramses-composer-logo.png)

This repository contains the documentation for Ramses Composer, the authoring tool for the open source RAMSES rendering ecosystem. In the [Ramses Composer User Manual](manual.md) you will find example projects demonstrating the various features of the tool alongside general information and tips how to create a well-designed 2D/3D scene.

## Related resources

You will find the source code of Ramses Composer and instructions on how to build it in the main [Ramses Composer repository](https://github.com/GENIVI/ramses-composer).

Ramses Composer builds on the the RAMSES logic engine ([user manual](https://ramses-logic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) / [source repository](https://github.com/GENIVI/ramses-logic)) and the RAMSES renderer ([wiki pages](https://github.com/GENIVI/ramses/wiki) / [API documentation](https://genivi.github.io/ramses/) / [source repository](https://github.com/GENIVI/ramses)).
